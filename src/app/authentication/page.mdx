# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Vatly API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. Vatly uses API keys to authenticate your API requests. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## API keys

To authenticate with the Vatly API, you need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request. You can obtain your API key from the [Vatly dashboard](https://my.vatly.com) under **Settings » API**.

Vatly provides separate API keys for live and test environments:

- **Live keys** are prefixed with `live_` and are used for production requests.
- **Test keys** are prefixed with `test_` and are used for testing and development.

<Note>
  Use your test API key during development to avoid affecting live data. Switch to your live API key when you're ready to go to production.
</Note>

Here's how to authenticate your requests using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with API key' }}
curl https://api.vatly.com/v1/checkouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer live_your_api_key_here"
```

Always keep your API key safe and never expose it in client-side code or commit it to version control. If you suspect your API key has been compromised, you can regenerate it from the Vatly dashboard.

## Using an SDK

If you use one of our official SDKs, authentication is straightforward. Simply provide your API key when initializing the client, and the SDK will handle the rest.

```php {{ title: 'PHP SDK example' }}
$vatly = new Vatly\Api\VatlyApiClient;
$vatly->setApiKey('live_your_api_key_here');
```
