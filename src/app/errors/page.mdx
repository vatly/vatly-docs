# Errors

This guide covers API error handling. We'll look at the status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code in the API response. If a response is unsuccessful, use the error type and message to understand what went wrong.

{/* <Note>
  Before reaching out to support with an error, please be aware that 99% of all
  reported errors are, in fact, user errors. Therefore, please carefully check
  your code before contacting Vatly support.
</Note> */}

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the Vatly API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error — this means there's an issue with the request.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error — this means the issue is on Vatly's end and we are automatically notified of the problem.
  </Property>
</Properties>
