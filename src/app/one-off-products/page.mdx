# One-off products

One-off products are digital products you can sell to your contacts and groups. When a contact buys a one-off product, an Order gets created and any webhooks configured through the dashboard get fired. {{ className: 'lead' }}

A one-off product is a digital product that can be bought once. {{ className: 'lead' }}
