# Instructions for Vatly docs

## Project overview

Your goal is to build a next.js app that allows users to get started with (Vatly)[https://vatly.com] a platform that enables EEA based SAAS to sell worldwide. This app serves all documentation for Vatly, including the API specifications, guides and instructions for using the app. Also references to SDKs and plugins will be included. On production it will be reachable on docs.vatly.com.

You will be using Next.js to build the app, with Tailwind CSS for styling and MDX for writing the documentation.

We take the Protocol template from TailwindUI as a starting point and build on it.
