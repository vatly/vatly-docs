title: "Pagination"
description: "In this guide, we will look at how to work with paginated responses when querying the Vatly API"
---

When an API response returns a list of objects, no matter the amount, pagination is supported. In paginated responses, objects are nested in a `data` attribute and have `links` with `next` and `prev` URLs for navigation. When `links.next` is `null`, you have reached the end of the results. You can use the `starting_after` and `ending_before` query parameters to browse pages.

## Example using cursors


  

    In this example, we request the page that starts after the checkout with id `chk_s4WycXedwhQrEFuM`. As a result, we get a list of three checkouts and can tell by `links.next` being `null` that we have reached the end of the resultset.

    | Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `starting_after` | `string` | The last ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the next page. |
| `ending_before` | `string` | The first ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the previous page. |
| `limit` | `integer` | Limit the number of items returned. |


  
  

    ```bash [Manual pagination using cURL]
    curl -G https://api.vatly.com/v1/checkouts \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer live_your_api_key_here" \
      -d starting_after="chk_s4WycXedwhQrEFuM" \
      -d limit=10
    ```

    ```json [Paginated response]
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "chk_WAz8eIbvDR60rouK",
          // ...
        },
        {
          "id": "chk_hSIhXBhNe8X1d8Et"
          // ...
        },
        {
          "id": "chk_fbwYwpi9C2ybt6Yb"
          // ...
        }
      ],
      "count": 3,
      "links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.vatly.com/v1/checkouts?starting_after=chk_s4WycXedwhQrEFuM&limit=10",
          "type": "application/json"
        },
        "next": null,
        "prev": {
          "href": "https://api.vatly.com/v1/checkouts?ending_before=chk_WAz8eIbvDR60rouK&limit=10",
          "type": "application/json"
        }
      }
    }
