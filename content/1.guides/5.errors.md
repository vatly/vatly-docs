You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code in the API response. If a response is unsuccessful, use the error type and message to understand what went wrong.

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the Vatly API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error. This means there's an issue with the request.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error. This means the issue is on Vatly's end and we are automatically notified of the problem.
  </Property>

## Error types


  

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Vatly API will return an error response with an error type and message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

  
  

    ```bash {{ title: "404 Error response" }}
    {
      "message": "Resource not found.",
    }
    ```
